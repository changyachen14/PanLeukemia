# Single-cell pan-leukemia signatures of HSPC-like blasts predict drug response and clinical outcome

The critical role of leukemic initiating cells as a therapy-resistant population in myeloid leukemia is well established, however, the molecular signatures of such cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain underexplored. Moreover, their role in therapy response and patient prognosis is yet to be systematically investigated across various types of acute leukemia. We employed single-cell multiomics to analyze diagnostic specimens from 96 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic, myeloid, and lineage ambiguous leukemias. Through the integration of single-cell multiomics with extensive bulk RNA-Seq and clinical datasets, we uncovered a prevalent, chemotherapy-resistant subpopulation that resembles hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC-like) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes across all subtypes investigated. We identified a core transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) in HSPC-like blasts that is combinatorically controlled by HOXA/AP1/CEBPA. This TRN signature can predict chemotherapy response and long-term clinical outcomes. We identified shared potential therapeutic targets against HSPC-like blasts, including FLT3, BCL2, and the PI3K pathway. Our study provides a framework for linking intra-tumoral heterogeneity with therapy response, patient outcome and discovery of new therapeutic targets for pediatric acute leukemias.
